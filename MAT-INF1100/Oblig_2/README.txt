This was my second assigment in this cours. 
Here my teacher had went for a run and tracked it trough GPS, he then uploaded this data on to web site. 
I applied Newton's law of motion on this data and found the speed and how far he ran.
I also experimented on the difference between Euler's method and Euler's midpoint method.

The assigment and my answer is shown in the PDF files.
My answer is coded with latex, the source code for my answer is .tex file
